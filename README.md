# 🤖 Discord Chatbot Server (Langflow Integration)

This is a Discord bot server that integrates with a Langflow API to process and respond to messages in Discord channels. The bot receives messages, sends them to the Langflow API, and replies with the generated response.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The Chatbot server is provided for educational and demonstration purposes. Use responsibly and at your own risk.

- **Bot tokens and API keys are sensitive.** Never share them or commit them to public repositories.
- Ensure you have permission to add bots to any Discord server.
- Review and limit bot permissions to only what is necessary.
- The authors are not responsible for any misuse or security issues.


## 🧩 How It Works

1. A user sends a message in a Discord channel where the bot is present.
2. The bot receives the message, sends it to the Langflow API (using your flow ID and API key from your .env).
3. The bot replies in the same channel with the generated response from Langflow.

## 🔑 Enable Discord Application & Get API Token

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name.
3. In the sidebar, go to **Bot** and click **Add Bot**.
4. Under **Token**, click **Reset Token** if needed, then **Copy** to get your bot token.
   - **Important:** Treat your bot token like a password. Never share it or commit it to public repositories.
5. Save this token for your `.env` file as `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.
6. To invite the bot to your server:
   - Go to **OAuth2** > **URL Generator**.
   - Under **Scopes**, select `bot`.
   - Under **Bot Permissions**, select at least:
     - `Send Messages`
     - `Read Message History`
     - `View Channels`
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.

### 🌐 Set Up OAuth and Select Discord Server

1. In the Discord Developer Portal, go to your application and select **OAuth2** > **URL Generator**.
2. Under **Scopes**, check `bot` (and optionally `applications.commands` if you use slash commands).
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, select the permissions your bot needs (see above).
4. Copy the generated OAuth2 URL.
5. Open the URL in your browser. You will be prompted to select a Discord server where you have permission to add bots.
6. Choose your server and authorize the bot.
7. The bot will be added to the selected server with the permissions you specified.

### 🛡️ Enable Bot Intents

To ensure your bot works correctly, you may need to enable specific Gateway Intents in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. In your application, go to the **Bot** section.
2. Scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents**.
3. Enable the following as needed:
   - `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT` (required to read message content)
   - `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT` (if your bot needs member info)
   - `PRESENCE INTENT` (if your bot needs presence info)
4. Save your changes.

Make sure your bot code requests only the intents you have enabled. If you use privileged intents in your code, they must be enabled here.


## ⚙️ Chatbot Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following (see dotenv-example):

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
LANGFLOW_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7860
LANGFLOW_FLOW_ID=your-flow-id(uuid)
LANGFLOW_API_KEY=your-langflow-api-key
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```


Run the bot locally:

```sh
npm start
```


If the bot starts successfully, you should see a log like:

```
Discord bot logged in as <your-bot-name>
```

Send a message in your Discord server to test the bot. The bot will reply using the Langflow API.


## 🚀 Deploy the Chatbot to Kubernetes

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t (your_docker_username)/genai-chatbot .
   ```
2. Push the image to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GCR, etc.).
3. Update the Kubernetes manifest (`chatbot.yaml`) with your image and environment variables.
4. Deploy to your cluster:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f chatbot.yaml
   ```
5. (Optional) Use the provided shell scripts for deployment:
   - `build-deploy-chatbot-k8s.sh` to build and deploy in one step
   - `deploy-chatbot-k8s.sh` to deploy only


## 💬 How to Use

Once the bot is running and invited to your server, simply type your question or prompt in any channel where the bot has access. The bot will process your message and reply with an answer generated by the Langflow API.

No special prefix is required unless you modify the code to require one.

## 📝 Notes

- The bot ignores its own messages and other bots to prevent loops.
- All configuration is done via the `.env` file (can be used as a K8s secret).
- For production, keep your bot token and API keys secure.

## 📚 Appendix

### Langflow API Reference

The bot uses the following Langflow API endpoint:

- `POST /api/v1/run/{flow_id}?wait=true` to run a flow and get the result

The payload includes your prompt and any required parameters for your Langflow flow.

See server.js for implementation details.
